I have been spying on the great wizard Albin for the past few months. I have noticed that he has set up a network where he lives that seems to be isolated from the rest of the world as not even I am able to access it remotely.
Could you go see if you can get into it and see if there is anything interesting on the network?

I have found one of Albins leaked password hashes from the dark web, 96ca0aa9838637795b3ef7557c23eab465b15cc487719f147199fcaa327f4db59f57116ee5017c4a952e9a6eea68c2a6810474a2d08fcf9c6ad8be42831cb36f - format seems to be SHA-512
Knowing how self-centered the wizard albin is it is bound to start or end with Albin. I have also noticed that Albin seems to like using the same password for everything. I also believe it's a relatively common password
