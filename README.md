I have been spying on the great wizard Albin for the past few months. I have noticed that he has set up a network where he lives that seems to be isolated from the rest of the world as not even I am able to access it remotely.
Could you go see if you can get into it and see if there is anything interesting on the network?

I have found one of Albins leaked password hashes from the dark web, ebde5ef3604bb77c497704f7079746b171e6f2b3560097a392d5883ae9fc2f18166145759d7ed03896fd0b3162e2f939c35f9bb49df77c3b8ccba3ea1dec06df - format seems to be SHA-512
Knowing how self-centered the wizard albin is it is bound to start or end with Albin. I have also noticed that Albin seems to like using the same password for everything. I also believe it's a relatively common password
